# DeepReinforcementLearningProject
This research uses Reinforcement Learning (RL)
 techniques to maximise resource allocation between a seller and
 a buyer in a dynamic marketplace. Its main objective is to
 alter the quality, price, and demand coefficients, all of which
 affect allocation. By ensuring that the total of these coefficients
 is near to 1, normalisation of the coefficients ensures a balanced
 distribution. These coefficients are refined repeatedly, accounting
 for previous interactions. The Seller wants to make the most
 money possible within the constraints of the given resources,
 while the Buyer seeks to get the most out of the allocation. The
 results demonstrate the effectiveness of RL-based optimisation in
 resource allocation. The project also provides visualisations show
ing how coefficient values change across iterations. Companies
 may adapt to changing market conditions and employ resources
 most effectively for their mutual advantage with the aid of this
 paradigm. It illustrates how real-world resource allocation issues
 in dynamic marketplaces may be resolved using reinforcement
 learning.
